# rustceptionist
This is a basic rust web server that will be expanded over time. It will handle HTTP requests for a future website that I plan to build over the next few months (as a try to force myself to learn HTML).

This is not finished, and I plan to implement more over time. Currently it only handles GET requests, but I plan to add more and the goal is to have a fully functioning website by the end of this with the rustceptionist web server completely handling it.
