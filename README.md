This is a basic rust web server that will be expanded over time. As of now it currently implements the:
* GET method

The website itself needs to be developed more, which I'd like to do once I have a little extra time and no other more cybersecurity related projects.

**Ideas**
* Another idea I have is to make this a web server for a C2. I've never worked with JavaScript or web assembly, so having this be the webserver for a C2 implant would be a lot more interesting.....
